Q. Naive Bayes classifier.
1. How is Naive Bayes classifier naive?
1. Let’s try to construct a Naive Bayes classifier to classify whether a tweet has a positive or negative sentiment. We have four training samples:

$$
\begin{bmatrix} 
    \text{Tweet} &  \text{Label} \\\\
    \text{This makes me so upset} & \text{Negative}\\\\
    \text{This puppy makes me happy} & \text{Positive} \\\\
    \text{Look at this happy hamster} & \text{Positive} \\\\
    \text{No hamsters allowed in my house} & \text{Negative}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

According to your classifier, what's sentiment of the sentence The hamster is upset with the puppy?
