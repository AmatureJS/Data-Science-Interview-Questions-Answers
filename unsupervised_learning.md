## General Concepts

1. What is unsupervised learning?
2. Name some scenarios where we can use unsupervised learning algorithms?
 




## Association Mining

## Cluserting


## Dimensionality Reduction

1. Why do we need dimensionality reduction?
2. Eigendecomposition is a common factorization technique used for dimensionality reduction. Is the eigendecomposition of a matrix always unique?
3. Name some applications of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
4. We want to do PCA on a dataset of multiple features in different ranges. For example, one is in the range $0-1$ and one is in the range $10 - 1000$. Will PCA work on this dataset?
5. Under what conditions can one apply eigendecomposition? What about SVD?
    1. What is the relationship between SVD and eigendecomposition?
    1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between PCA and SVD?
6. How does $t-SNE$ (T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) work? Why do we need it?
7. Is it good to use PCA as a feature selection method?
8. Is PCA a linear model or non-linear model?
