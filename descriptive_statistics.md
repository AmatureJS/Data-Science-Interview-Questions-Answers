Q. Define histogram?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The histogram is a graphical display of the distribution of a quantitative variable.

</details>

---

Q. Write the steps of plotting histogram?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

- Collect and Organize Data: Sort the data into intervals or bins. Each bin will represent a range of values.
- Determine Bin Intervals: Decide the width of each bin, which depends on the range and distribution of your data. This step often involves balancing between having too many narrow bins or too few wide bins.
-  Count Frequencies: Count how many data points fall into each bin. This gives you the frequency of data points within each interval.
- Set Up the Axes: X-axis(bin intervals) and Y-axis(frequency or count of data points)
- Draw the Bars: For each bin, draw a bar that reaches up to the frequency count on the Y-axis. The width of each bar corresponds to the width of the bin interval, and the height corresponds to the frequency.
- Label the Histogram: Add title, axes labels and legends

</details>

---

Q. What is mean of a distribution?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The mean is the average of a set of observations (i.e., the sum of the observations divided by the number of observations). If the n observations are $x_1, x_2,..,x_n$ their mean, which we denote by $\bar{x}$

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n}{n}
$$

</details>

---

Q. What is median of a distribution? 

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The median M is the midpoint of the distribution. It is the number such that half of the observations fall above, and half fall below.

</details>

---

Q. How can we calculate median of a distribution? 

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

To find the median:

- Order the data from smallest to largest.
- Consider whether $n$, the number of observations, is even or odd.
   - If $n$ is odd, the median $M$ is the center observation in the ordered list. This observation is the one "sitting" in the $(n + 1)/2$ spot in the ordered list.
   - If $n$ is even, the median $M$ is the mean of the two center observations in the ordered list. These two observations are the ones "sitting" in the $n/2$ and $n/2 + 1$ spots in the ordered list.

</details>

---

Q. State the main difference between mean and median?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The mean is very sensitive to outliers (because it factors in their magnitude), while the median is resistant to outliers.

</details>

---

Q. How can we decide which measure should we choose as center of distribution?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The mean is an appropriate measure of center only for symmetric distributions with no outliers. In all other cases, the median should be used to describe the center of the distribution.

</details>

---

Q. What are commonly used measures of spread?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

- Range
- Inter-quartile range (IQR)
- Standard deviation

</details>

---

Q. What do you mean by range of a distribution?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The range covered by the data is the most intuitive measure of variability. The range is exactly the distance between the smallest data point (min) and the largest one (Max).

$$
\text{Range} = \text{Max} - \text{Min}
$$

</details>

---

Q. What is IQR? How can we calculate it?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

IQR measures the variability of a distribution by giving us the range covered by the middle $50%$ of the data.

<tr>
<td align="center">
    <img src="img/IQR.png" alt= "IQR" style="max-width:70%;"/>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"> Inter Quartile Range(IQR) </td>
</tr>
</table>

IQR calculations:

- Arrange the data in increasing order, and find the median M. Recall that the median divides the data, so that 50% of the data points are below the median, and 50% of the data points are above the median.

- Find the median of the lower 50% of the data($Q1$) and upper 50% of the data $Q3$.

- The middle 50% of the data falls between $Q1$ and $Q3$, and therefore:

$$
\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1
$$

</details>

---

Q. Can we use IQR to detect outliers?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Yes, we can use IQR as basis for a rule of thumb for identifying outliers. 

It is $1.5(IQR)$ criteria for outliers. An observation is considered a suspected outlier if it is:

- below Q1 - 1.5(IQR) or
- above Q3 + 1.5(IQR)

Q. How to deal with outliers in the data?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

We can handle outliers with following approach:
- Identifying the outlier
- Understanding the outlier
- Decide how to handle the outlier

</details>

---

Q. What are the five-number summary statistics of a distribution?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The five-number summary of a distribution consists of the median (M), the two quartiles (Q1, Q3) and the extremes (min, Max).

</details>

---

Q. What is a box-plot?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The boxplot graphically represents the distribution of a quantitative variable by visually displaying the five-number summary and any observation that was classified as a suspected outlier using the *1.5(IQR)* criterion.

</table>

</details>

---

Q. State one benefit of using box-plot?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Boxplots are most useful when presented side-by-side to compare and contrast distributions from two or more groups.

</details>

---

Q. What does the standard deviation represent in a distribution?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

standard deviation quantifies the spread of a distribution by measuring how far the observations are from their mean $\bar{x}$. The standard deviation gives the average (or typical distance) between a data point and the mean $\bar{x}$.

$$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}$$

where:
- $N$ is the number of observations in the population.
- $x_i$ represents each individual observation.
- $\mu$ is the mean of the population.

</details>

---

Q. What is the benefit of using IQR over SD for measure of spread?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The SD is strongly influenced by outliers in the data.

</details>

---

Q. Given the array $[1,5,3,2,4,4]$, find its mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Given:

$$arr = [1, 5, 3, 2, 4, 4]$$

Sort the above series in ascending order:

$$arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]$$

<b>Mean($\bar{x}$)</b>

$$\bar{x}= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}arr}{n}$$

Here number of elements(n) = 6

$$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{6}arr}{6} = \frac{1+2+3+4+4+5}{6} = 3.166$$

<b>Median($M$)</b>

Since $n$ is even, we can use following expression:

$$\text{M} = \frac{x_{\frac{n}{2}} + x_{\frac{n}{2}+1}}{2}$$
$$\text{M} = \frac{3+4}{2} = 3.5$$

<b>Variance($\sigma^2$)</b>

$$\text{\sigma^2} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2$$
$$\text{\sigma^2} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - 3.166)^2$$
$$\text{\sigma^2} â‰ˆ 1.47$$

<b>Standard deviation($\sigma$)</b>

$$\text{\sigma} = \sqrt{variance} = \sqrt{1.47}$$

$$\text{\sigma} = 1.2124$$

</details>

---

Q. How do we determine which numerical summaries to use for describing a distribution?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

- Use $\bar{x}$ (the mean) and the standard deviation $\sigma$ as measures of center and spread only for reasonably symmetric distributions with no outliers.

- Use the five-number summary (which gives the median, IQR and range) for all other cases.

</details>

---

Q. State standard deviation rule?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

For distributions having bell shaped (also known as the normal shape), the following rule applies:
- Approximately $68%$ of the observations fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean.
- Approximately $95%$ of the observations fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean.
- Approximately $99.7%$ (or virtually all) of the observations fall within $3$ standard deviations of the mean.
