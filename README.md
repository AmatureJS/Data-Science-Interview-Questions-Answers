# Data Science Interview Questions and Answers

Greetings :wave:

This repository serves as an invaluable resource for your data science interviews, catering to individuals ranging from beginners to seasoned professionals. I have compiled a comprehensive collection of topics commonly encountered in typical data science interviews. To enhance readability and comprehension, I've organized the entire syllabus into distinct categories.

The repository features a wealth of questions that draw from my personal interview experiences and the study materials I consulted during my own preparations. I've curated an extensive selection of over <b>1000+</b> questions spanning various domains, with accompanying answers based on my interpretations and research. If you happen to come across any errors or have suggestions for refining specific answers, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via email at sajit9285@gmail.com or connect with me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sajit9285/">LinkedIn</a>.

I wholeheartedly welcome contributions from anyone interested in enriching this repository. If you'd like to contribute, simply submit a pull request with a meaningful message, and I will review and merge it if deemed necessary or directly ping me on my LinkedIn.

*Happy Learning!*
